                    <strong>Q: Are there any prizes for top players in the Pro League?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Prizes for top players are to be determined. (If you're interested in sponsoring the Pro League, please contact us.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: How does one gain an automatic invite to the Pro League?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Anyone who is currently on a team for the continent's top division or has played matches totaling half a season in that division in the past will be automatically detected by the system and granted access. (For North America, this means being rostered on an current ESEA Invite team or having previously played 8 matches in Invite. For Europe, the requirement is being on a current ETF2L Premiership team or having 4 Premiership matches played in the past.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: If I do not meet the requirements for automatically qualifying to the Pro League, how else can I qualify?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Each month, a certain number of players (based on having a high standing in the open system) will receive a promotion to the Pro League. This number is variable and subject to determination by the organizers in order to keep the Pro League both sustainable and competitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: What are the circumstances in which a player is relegated from the Pro League?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Each month, any player whose rating lower bound (calculated as three rating deviations below the rating mean) is negative will be deemed uncompetitive and relegated from the Pro League. This determination applies regardless of whether the player received automatic qualification or manual promotion to the Pro League, so all players can be affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Are ratings maintained over time for the Pro League?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: No. Each month, every player's Pro League rating will be reset to the starting level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Are Pro League players restricted to playing in the Pro League?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: No! Pro League players are free to participate in the open systems like any other player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Are their special policies applying to Pro League players?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Yes, Pro League members are expected to follow higher standards as their actions will be more closely scrutinized. Further details are available in the <a href="{{site.github.url}}/rules/#pro-expectations">Pro Expectations section of the rules</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Do the Pro League services have different settings from the open systems?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Yes, Pro League settings are optimized for a system where the skill level is higher and more balanced. Altered settings include the substitute selection process, captain selection, map pool, and draft process.
