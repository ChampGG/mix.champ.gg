                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>

                    Play to the best of your ability.
                    <br>
                    Promptly arrive in the game server and Mumble voice server once you have been confirmed into a game. You are required to communicate in mumble with your team. Please be respectful to other players in mumble.
                    <br>
                    Play for the full length of the game and do not leave early.
                    <br>
                    Do not excessively play roles that you were not drafted to play.
                    <br>
                    Excessive off-classing or running heavy, engie, pyro, or spy to mid will result in a restriction. Off-classing for more then 30% of the pug could result in a ban.
                    <br>
                    Stop off-classing if members or your team ask you.
                    <br>
                    Do not play with the intent to ruin a pug or troll.

                <p class="text-faded">Cheating (defined as <em>attempting to obtain and utilize an unfair advantage against other players</em>) is a serious violation of competitive integrity and cannot be tolerated.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">As such, any player suspected of cheating will be immediately and indefinitely suspended. A team will then review all available evidence (including any submitted by the player) to determine the player's guilt. If cheating is determined to be probable, the player will be permanently banned.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">In addition, for the protection of the service, new accounts deemed to be suspicious may be suspended until further investigation.</p>

                    <strong>Q: Under what circumstances am I allowed to play other roles?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Generally, you should play the role you were drafted to play. The one recognized exception is offclassing (from scout or roamer) in order to attack or defend the final control point. Players who are deemed to be excessively offclassing may be restricted.

                    <strong>Q: I am listed as a Captain. What does this mean?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: As your team's Captain, it is your responsibility to make sure that your team is playing to the best of their abilities, request subs and your team is following the rules. If something happens in a Pug, please contact an Admin and we can help you sort out any issues. If you leave a pug as Captain, you must request a sub for yourself and leave a message in chat to let an admin know.
